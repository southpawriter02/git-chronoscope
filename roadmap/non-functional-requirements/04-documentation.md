# Documentation

## 1. Description

This document outlines the documentation that should be created for the Git Time-Lapse tool. Clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial for user adoption and community contributions.

## 2. Target Audience

The documentation should be written for different audiences:

- **End-users:** People who want to use the tool to generate time-lapses.
- **Developers/Contributors:** People who want to contribute to the development of the tool.

## 3. User Documentation

- **Installation Guide:** Detailed instructions on how to install the tool and its dependencies on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). This should include instructions for installing from a package manager, from source, and using Docker.
- **Quick Start Guide:** A tutorial that walks the user through the process of generating their first time-lapse.
- **User Manual:** A comprehensive guide that explains all the features and command-line options of the tool. This should include examples for all the different rendering options, output formats, and advanced features.
- **Troubleshooting Guide:** A list of common problems and their solutions.
- **Examples Gallery:** A collection of example time-lapses generated with the tool, showcasing its capabilities.

## 4. Developer Documentation

- **Contributing Guide:** Instructions on how to set up the development environment, run the tests, and submit pull requests. This should also include information about the project's coding style and conventions.
- **Architecture Overview:** A high-level overview of the tool's architecture, explaining the main components and how they interact.
- **API Reference:** If the tool provides a library that can be used by other programs, a detailed API reference should be generated automatically from the source code comments.
- **Roadmap:** The roadmap itself (the documents we are creating now) should be part of the developer documentation.

## 5. Website

- A dedicated website should be created for the project to host the documentation, examples, and other relevant information. GitHub Pages can be used for this purpose. The website should be well-designed and easy to navigate.
