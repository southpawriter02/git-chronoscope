# Git Time-Lapse Roadmap

This document outlines the roadmap for the Git Time-Lapse project. The project aims to create a tool that generates a time-lapse video of a Git repository's history, visualizing the evolution of the codebase over time.

This roadmap is organized into the following sections:

- **Core Functionality:** The essential features required for the initial version of the tool.
- **Advanced Features:** Enhancements and new capabilities to be added in future releases.
- **Integrations:** Integrating the tool with other platforms and services.
- **Performance and Scalability:** Improvements to ensure the tool is fast and can handle large repositories.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** System requirements, dependencies, limitations, and documentation.

Each feature is detailed in its own Markdown file, located in the corresponding subdirectory. These files provide exhaustive explanations about intended functionalities, requirements, limitations, and dependencies.
